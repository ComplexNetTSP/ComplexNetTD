To install Anaconda, please see [here](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install). Make sure you get the version compatible with your OS (Mac, Linux, or Windows). If you'd like a more comprehensive document, please check out CS109's guide [here](https://github.com/cs109/content/wiki/Installing-Python).\n",

    "## Python Shell\n",
    "The Python Interactive Shell is a light-weight way to explore Python. It's commonly used for debugging, quick tasks, and as a calculator! To get to the shell, open Terminal and type `python`. More instructions are located [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/interpreter.html). The following sections will be done in the shell to allow you to get a feel for Python.\n",

For these examples, we will focus on using adjacency lists.\n",

    "# Breadth First Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Breadth first search (BFS) is a common and useful graph traversal algorithm. A graph traversal algorithm describes a process for visiting the nodes in a tree or graph, where traversing from one node to another is only allowed if there is an edge connecting those vertices. A motivational property of BFS is that it can find connectivity and shortest distances between two nodes in graphs. For this class, we will apply BFS to compute centrality measures and other graph properties. In this lab we will study how BFS runs, how to implement it, and how it can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queue\n",
    "Before we can begin to study BFS, we need to understand the queue data structure. Similar to the non-computer science understanding of the word, a queue is essentially a line. Data, in our case nodes or vertices, enter the queue and are stored there. The operation of adding data to a queue is called enqueue() or push(). The order in which they enter the queue is preserved. When we need to retrieve data, we take the earliest element from the queue and it is removed from the queue. This operation is called dequeue() or pop(). This is referred to as <i>first-in-first-out</i> (FIFO).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can implement a queue naively as a list. However, lists were not built for this purpose, and do not have efficient push() and pop() operations. Alternatives include implementations included in libraries (which we will be using) or defining your own class and operations. For this lab we will use the queue data structure from the 'collections' library (https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.deque)."

    "Recall that a graph traversal is a route of nodes to follow or traverse, where we can only move between two nodes if there is an edge between them. Breadth first search specifies a process for doing so. In the simplest implementation, BFS visits a given node, adds its neighbors to the queue, then visits the element returned by the queue. To begin the BFS, we start at a given node, then visit all of that node's nieghbors, then visit all of one neighbor's neighbors, then another neighbor's neighbors, etc. Whenever we visit a node for the first time, we mark it as visited; otherwise we do nothing when re-visiting a node. The algorithm terminates once we have visited everything reachable from the given node, and we have a list of nodes reachable from that node.\n",
